# Housing First: A proven effective solution

The first thing that we both agreed on right off the bat is that the priority of any program that addresses homelessness should be to provide these people with housing, no strings attached. This is also known as [Housing First](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/), a policy that has been implemented in many areas throughout the United States and Europe and has shown to be [more cost-effective](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764096/homeless-shelter-housing-help-solutions) than previous solutions which prioritize shelters and other assistance (or worse yet, [spending millions simply arresting people on the streets](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-homeless-cao-report-20150416-story.html)). This is largely because when people have their own space, they are in a better mental and emotional position to pull themselves up and start acquiring financial stability. Alongside housing, these programs generally offer mental health resources, employment opportunities, domestic violence support, and more. Perhaps the best success story of Housing First is in Finland, where [homelessness has fallen by more than 35%](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness) since introducing the policy in 2008 and placing major emphasis on it.

# An obstacle to affordable housing: zoning laws

In order to allocate housing development resources in the most efficient way possible and provide for the most amount of people, we need to build apartments. There are many things that slow this down—[supportive housing projects in LA](https://lacontroller.org/audits-and-reports/hhhactionplan/), for example, go through an arduous process of “applying for funding, securing land use approvals, engaging the community and obtaining permits”, not to mention the[ environmental regulations they have to comply with](https://planning.lacity.org/development-services/environmental-review) — but the major obstacle is the fact that large portions of these cities are often [zoned exclusively for single-family homes](https://planning.lacity.org/zoning/new-code). One of the reasons for this is the belief held by property owners that the existence of lower-income and subsidized homes in their area will decrease the value of their property. While this is sound economic theory, it doesn’t always play out this way in practice.

# How does more housing impact property value?

Multiple analyses have shown that many of the concerns regarding subsidized housing are unfounded. [A Stanford study](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/06/a-surprising-way-to-increase-property-values/.) from 2017 found that low-income housing built in poorer neighborhoods actually led to an increase to overall property values, an increase of 6.5% within 0.25 miles of the housing development. In wealthier and whiter neighborhoods, there was a decrease in property values of 2.5% within one tenth of a mile within the housing development. In any case, the effects of housing are contained to a small area and are not very dramatic. [A different analysis](http://www.trulia.com/research/low-income-housing/.) by the real estate firm, Trulia, found that there was no significant effect on property values in America’s twenty least affordable markets.

Even if it were true that subsidized housing would be a large threat to property values, we should remember that establishing good policy requires setting our priorities straight. If you’ve ever been in an area where many are living on the streets, and seen the degree of suffering that these people experience, then you should recognize the urgency that this issue carries in spite of any potential market losses. The fact that profits of property owners don‘t seem to be significantly affected by their proximity to low-income housing is simply an added bonus that makes these programs more politically viable.

# Cultural barriers

A study conducted by YouGov and written about in the[ Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/14/americans-want-to-help-the-homeless-as-long-as-theyre-not-around-this-explains-why/.) found that many people hold contradictory and toxic attitudes regarding the homeless population, which can often be fueled by disgust. The people surveyed supported policies such as providing housing, but opposed policies like sleeping in public or panhandling; which would be criminalizing homelessness. The main driver is disgust, driven by a perception of homelessness people are potential sources of disease. This perception and dehumanization of people experiencing homelessness is coupled with this psychological mechanism to cause people to feel an aversion to the homeless.

The study found that the coverage or perceptions of the homeless can also affect the disgust the general population feels towards the homeless population. In an experiment within the study, participants were put into two separate groups and given reading materials about the homeless population. The control group read a generic article, and the second group read an article that emphasized issues like public urination, littering, etc. The result was that the second group was far more likely to be in favor of bans on sleeping in public and panhandling. Clearly there is an element of cultural disgust that is fueled by media coverage, and this can have a dehumanizing effect on the homeless population that weakens the political viability of helping these people.

# Contemporary policy and the history that informs it

The Trump administration’s [most recent HUD budget request](http://nlihc.org/resource/analysis-president-trumps-fy-2021-budget-request.) for the fiscal year 2021 proposed 6.1 billion dollars in cuts to affordable housing programs, and a total cut of 8.6 billion dollars to HUD. He boasted that [“there will be no more low-income housing forced into the suburbs”](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/29/trump-housing-policy-low-income-suburbs-386414), playing into fears that have existed in this country for nearly a century. Characterizing the movement of people from urban and poor areas as an invading one has its roots in racist and prejudiced attitudes that resulted from systemic housing discrimination.

[Redlining](https://www.thoughtco.com/redlining-definition-4157858) was a practice where the FHA mapped out areas considered to be risky investments as red zones. As a consequence, white people had a massive edge in accessing valuable suburban homes. This created a cultural divide between white suburbia and the predominantly black and Latino urban areas. This has larger economic implications, since owning property is one of the best ways for families to build wealth over generations. Understanding this history provides comments of protecting suburbia in a more complete context.

Another example of Trump utilizing [dog whistles](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dog-whistle) was when he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1293517514798960640) that he represented the “suburban housewife” vote, and would ensure their safety by ending the “low income housing [invasion]…”. Not only does this use the previously discussed trope of urban invasion, but also plays into the harmful narrative that women, in particular white women, need protection, specifically from black or Latino men. [This was a trope that fueled racist organizations, such as the KKK in the 1920s, and has a culturally significant history.](https://timeline.com/the-kkk-started-a-branch-just-for-women-in-the-1920s-and-half-a-million-joined-72ab1439b78b)

While Trump is only one man and will not be president for much longer, he represents a cultural attitude held by many Americans. We are both of the mindset that many of one’s attitudes and beliefs about the world are determined by social circumstances, or the world that we are raised in. The solution to combat this issue is to better understand the language that is fueled by racism and prejudice when it is used to advocate for harmful policies.

# **A New Low-Cost Solution: 3D Printed Houses**

On a lighter note, thanks to recent technological breakthroughs, there is one upcoming strategy that may not require zoning changes, cultural shifts, or huge investments. New firms have cropped up — [ICON](https://www.iconbuild.com), [Mighty Buildings](https://www.mightybuildings.com), [SQ4D](https://www.sq4d.com), and more — that are revolutionizing housing construction using 3D printing. The process, [which in ICON’s case combines robotics, software, and a new advanced material called Lavacrete](https://www.iconbuild.com/technology), is quite fascinating and unlike anything that’s been seen before. Due to the economic and technological efficiency of this process, houses can be built in less than 48 hours, cost less than $10,000 (sometimes under $4K) per unit, and require very little manual labor.

After successfully building a prototype in Austin, Texas, ICON has teamed up with an organization called New Story to [build an entire community of low-cost 3D printed homes](https://newstorycharity.org/3d-community/), donated to 50 families in Mexico who are living on less than $3 a day. This is an important testing ground for the viability of prioritizing this type of housing development in solving homelessness everywhere. Especially with so many barriers prolonging the process of building affordable housing in major cities, this could really be a game changer.

# Conclusion: What can you do?

You’ve already done the first step by learning more about this issue and being interested in what you can do to help! These are some ways that we can all play a part in the solution to end homelessness:

- [Donate to our fundraiser for New Story](https://www.facebook.com/solnspodcast/posts/149241496955657), an organization that is giving 3D printed houses to families in need, sparking a low-cost revolution that will be essential to solving this issue worldwide.

- Acquaint yourself with the experiences of unhoused individuals by taking the time to talk with people who are on the streets, and by watching content from channels like [Invisible People](https://www.youtube.com/user/invisiblepeopletv).

- Vote for [Housing First](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/) and [upzoning](https://www.sightline.org/upzoning/) policies so that our tax dollars can go towards building permanent housing solutions aimed at getting people off of the streets, out of shelters, and into comfortable homes.

- Donate and volunteer at your local homeless shelters and soup kitchens. They are often in need of [warm clothes, hygiene items, towels, and more](https://www.therenewalproject.com/what-homeless-shelters-really-need/). [National Coalition for the Homeless](https://nationalhomeless.org/references/directory/) features several directories where you can find organizations in need of help. If you’re in the Orange County area, you can also get in touch with [Wound Walk](https://woundwalk.org), a newly-formed group that delivers medical services using donated items.

- If you are a manager or business owner and your office is in a densely populated city, consider letting employees and future hires work from home and live in different areas. This can help reduce housing demand and population density in cities, bringing housing prices down to affordable rates.
