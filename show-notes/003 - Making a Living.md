_Is there a topic you want us to cover? [Let us know!](https://solutions-ideas.herokuapp.com/)_

The United States economy, the wealthiest in the world, has seen huge gains thanks to technological innovation, new industries, and global trade. Yet the wages of everyday Americans have largely been stagnant since the 1970s, keeping up only with inflation and not the rising cost of living.

In the third episode of Solutions, we discuss why wages have stagnated, and what it will take to ensure the financial security of all working Americans. We’ll examine the latest evidence on the impact of minimum wages, but also why raising the minimum wage won’t be enough, as the complexity of today’s economy demands tackling this issue from multiple angles.

# Wages have kept up with inflation, but not living costs

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1280/0*EfqQT65Wh0blIbRD.png)

Real wages (the value of wages after being adjusted for inflation) have [barely budged in the past 50 years](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/). Meanwhile, the cost of living, as estimated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has risen, with [housing prices rising 34% after inflation since 1999](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-does-current-cost-living-compare-20-years-ago.asp). Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, with over half reporting that they have [little to no money set aside for unexpected expenses](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-2015-10-06), and [40% struggling to pay for basic necessities like food or rent](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/40-of-americans-struggle-to-pay-for-one-basic-need-like-food-housing-or-health-care-2018-08-28).

In addition, the contract workforce is growing, with [1 in 5 jobs being held by contractors](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/578825135/rise-of-the-contract-workers-work-is-different-now), some full-time and some using it as [supplemental income](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/smart-money/side-hustles-survey-june-2018/). These workers often have income that varies seasonally or monthly, and while many of them enjoy the flexibility, this can also result in financial instability for those who are dependent on this income. In solving this problem, we’ll need to not only account for those earning a steady wage that isn’t high enough, but also those whose income is less stable for various reasons.

# But the economy is growing. Why haven’t our paychecks done the same?

There are many reasons that businesses aren’t passing increased profits down to their workers. Some have argued that this is the result of [flawed business decisions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2018/10/31/why-arent-wages-keeping-up-its-not-the-economy-its-management/?sh=374644b2397e) that undervalue worker satisfaction (often informed by the sticky wage theory — that any raises given during a boom will be difficult to take back during a bust). But in addition to executive decisions, there are economic factors that play into wages. Basic economic theory tends to hold true that more job offerings and less workers results in higher wages as employers raise wages to attract workers. Inversely, when there are less jobs in an area and more people willing to work, employers have no incentive to make their job offers enticing. The most extreme, yet increasingly common, example of this is when there is one company controlling the job market in a particular area. [Researchers from the National Bureau of Economic Research](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/wage-stagnation-in-america) examined county-level figures on wages and productivity from 300,000 manufacturing plants spanning from 1977 to 2009, and found that manufacturing plants that were the only ones within a given area had consistently lower wages regardless of the plant’s productivity or profits. As manufacturing jobs became more scarce but the supply of labor remained the same, employers have an ability to exploit the high demand of employment to the detriment of the wage earners.

Part of why there is a lower supply of manufacturing jobs is due to free trade policies, which have allowed corporations to replace domestic labor with cheaper labor overseas. There are many who claim that the use of overseas labor not only causes Americans to lose jobs, but also negatively effects our overall wages since overseas labor is cheaper and increases the supply. There is certainly evidence to support this idea, as one study has found a correlation between [regions exposed to Chinese competition and reduced wages](https://ourworldindata.org/trade-wages-cost-living). Most of these harms have been felt within a very specific economic community, however, and on the whole free trade tends to be a net positive due to the fact that it increases economic growth. For example, studies have estimated that the GDP of the EU nations [would be approximately 8.7% lower](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/focus/arguments-for-and-against-free-trade/#.YLULvIWSmUl) if the member nations were not able to freely trade with each other. Not only this, but the prices of goods are lowered as countries with lower production costs are able to compete in the market, thus driving the prices down for everyone. This doesn’t undo the harm done to those in the US who have had their jobs replaced by overseas labor, and often times the gains made from lowered prices of goods doesn’t outweigh the lack of good-paying manufacturing jobs. This doesn’t change the fact that the US cannot realistically disengage from the world economy, but that doesn’t mean that those who have been negatively affected by specific trade policies shouldn’t be helped. The solution is to provide redistributive tax policies to take the gains from engaging in trade to aid those who are negatively affected by it.

When analyzing how a higher supply of labor can result in less competitive wages, a natural question to ask is whether immigration plays a role in this. Immigration brings a high labor supply and reduces the amount of available jobs for citizens living here, which may lead to the conclusion that immigration brings down wages overall. [A report from The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration) examined 20 years of data and found that **immigrants presented a net benefit to the economy and the effect on wages is very small**, but that there were some negative impacts on the wages of laborers who do not have a high school education, as well as second generation immigrants. Additionally, immigrant workers that are here illegally are more easily able to be exploited by lower wages, having a further depressing effect on wages overall. Some economists like George J. Borjas argue that immigrants harm the wages of low-skilled workers without an education [anywhere from $800-$1,500 per year.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216) While the severity of immigration's impact on these wages is contested, most economists acknowledge that this is a real phenomenon. However, what these same economists will tell you is that this isn't nearly enough to raise any alarms about letting too many people into the country. **The truth is that immigrants largely contribute to our economy and overall growth**. Even those who take Borjas' position agree that the increase of people into the country presents at least a potential net positive to the economy, and that it would be unwise to cut back on immigration due to economic concerns. It's crucial, however, that we enact policies to redistribute the profits that immigration brings to our thriving economy and provide better wages for all low-skilled and low-educated workers, regardless of whether or not they were born in this country.

So if executive decisions and economic factors have clearly led to a stagnation of wages over time, why has government policy been slow to take this into account? Simply put, the actions of politicians over the past few decades have been led by bad economic theory, namely neoliberalism and the idea that as long as businesses are doing well, wealth will trickle down over time. Trickle-down economics posits that cutting taxes and regulations for the wealthiest members of society will result in economic growth that will benefit everyone, and the increases in everyone’s profits will replace the tax revenue that was lost from lowering taxes on the wealthiest earners. This theory has no evidence to support it, and does nothing but continue wealth inequality. According to a study done by the [London School of Economics](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/107919/1/Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf), trickle-down economics hasn’t been demonstrated to work for 18 different countries spanning sixty years. Not only were tax revenues not increased, but neither were wages. The only thing that increased was the disparity of wealth disparity from the poor and the rich. The Trump 2017 tax cuts, the most recent implementation of this policy, [also failed to raise revenue](https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/did-the-2017-tax-cut-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-pay-for-itself/). This implies that wages were not either substantially raised or that there was a massive increase in jobs, since the theory posits that raised wages will increase tax revenue. In short, trickle-down economics doesn’t work because the wealthy hold on to their wealth. Despite this, trickle-down has been the dominant economic theory for the past few decades, and only recently are mainstream economists beginning to acknowledge its flaws to a large degree.

In summary, the crisis of wage stagnation can be traced to bad business decisions, a lack of jobs, and a lack of government willpower to fix the issue thanks to being led by bad economic theories. The United States has fallen massively behind on this issue for decades, and it’s time for policy to catch up with reality.

# Is raising the minimum wage the answer?

There is much debate in the country regarding whether or not the increase in the federal minimum wage would be a valid solution to the issue of stagnated wages. Most recently, Democrats attempted unsuccessfully [to pass an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 dollars an hour in the most recent COVID-19 relief package](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-clash-over-15-minimum-wage-covid-relief-package-n1257077). The minimum wage increase, had it passed, would have raised the wages of approximately 27 million workers either earning below are near $15 dollars an hour, [according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/15-minimum-wage-would-benefit-27-million-us-workers-.html). The Congressional Budget Office report also claimed that the raising the federal minimum wage would also decrease employment as much as 0.9%. This specific claim, as well as other claims regarding raising the minimum wage having a significant negative impact on employment, have been challenged. Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts Arindrajit Dube makes the argument in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/24/minimum-wage-economic-research-job-loss/) that that same CBO report also admits that income gains from the minimum wage increase would outweigh the reductions in income from job losses, which demonstrates that the value of higher paying jobs would more than compensate for the less significant increase in unemployment. Dube also argues, citing research that he and other colleagues published in the [Quarterly Journal of Economics](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905), that increases in minimum wages on the state level had no significant effects on unemployment in the 138 cases of minimum wage increases from 1979 to 2016. While there was a decrease in jobs below the minimum wage relative to states that did not raise their minimum wage, there was an equal increase in the jobs at the new wage. Low wage job figures were not significantly affected, even when examining the most vulnerable group, that being young low-wage workers with no higher education. This isn’t to say that a rise in the minimum wage wouldn’t possibly have negative effect on employment, but Dube argues that [the minimum wage would have to be raised to a value not yet seen](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.35.1.3).

Different regions of the a country are affected differently when a federal minimum wage is increased. For example, examining the national minimum wage increases in the UK, [one study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/c0541) found that in the north had a harder time absorbing the costs of increases to the national minimum wage. While the study does say that overall employment levels were barely affected and acknowledges the gains to the national minimum wage have for low-paid workers, it also encourages governing bodies to consider the effects of raising the minimum wage on more vulnerable regions within the nation. This demonstrates that this concern is based in some kind of real phenomenon and should be taken into account, but how serious would these losses be in the US?

A [Mother Jones article](https://www.motherjones.com/food/2019/07/will-a-15-minimum-wage-kill-jobs-and-hurt-the-poor/) goes in depth regarding a [UC Berkley study](https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2020/09/Minimum-Wage-Effects-in-Low-Wage-Areas.pdf) which aimed to assess the effect of a higher minimum wage on overall employment using the “relative minimum wage” ratio. This ratio compares the minimum wage of a given area to the median wage of that area; the closer to one the value is, the closer the minimum wage is to the median household income is. The purpose of this value is to determine whether or not firms in a given area would be able to absorb the increase in cost that a minimum wage might yield. The federal relative minimum wage today is 0.36, the lowest of any industrialized nation in the world. Increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 dollars an hour would take that value to the highest of any industrialized nation, 0.68. In states that currently have low median incomes, like Mississippi, this ratio could be as high as 0.85. While this ratio is unheard of on the state and federal level, it isn’t unheard of at the county level, where this value can get as high as 0.82. Examining data on a county by county basis, the researchers were able to determine that the minimum wage increase decreased poverty and increased wages, while also not having a significant impact on jobs. Any harms that would be felt would likely be made up for by the increase in incomes, as we established earlier in this article when discussing the CBO report.

While this UC Berkeley report is encouraging, this doesn’t negate the evidence from the UK and the Congressional Budget Office about potential negative repercussions related to employment. However, examining the plurality of data demonstrates that these losses would be insignificant to the gains made with regards to overall wages and poverty reduction. Additionally, any implementation of the minimum wage would be done gradually over the course of years, in an effort to adjust for areas that would have higher relative minimum wages and reduce the chance of shock. This has been the case for any implementation of the minimum wage, and perhaps an option to avoid shock could allow each municipality to raise the wages at their own pace. Furthermore, by coupling the minimum wage increase with policy that increases jobs, the risks could be dramatically decreased. Every economic policy has positives and negatives, and while it's wise to have caution, there are also situations where action is long overdue and something must be done. We believe that everyone deserves a livable wage, and that raising the federal minimum wage to at least $15 would go a long way towards achieving that.

# Other ways to raise wages

Despite it gaining popularity in recent years, we know from [recent attempts](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/minimum-wage-senate.html) that raising the minimum wage on the federal level is still a politically difficult task. People are struggling now and need a solution. Here are some ideas that don’t require federal legislation, many of which have proven to be effective:

- **State and local minimum wages.** Especially in blue states and in cities with thriving economies, many organizers have had success raising minimum wages non-federally. Seven states — [California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx) — plus Washington D.C., have legislation in place to raise the minimum wage up to $15 an hour within the next few years.

- **Establishing per-industry policies through “wage boards”.** One of the most interesting wage victories came from New York in 2015. Governor Cuomo had attempted a minimum wage increase via budget legislation, but it was struck down. So he directed the labor commissioner to arrange a **wage board** — a panel to discuss and implement a fair minimum wage through negotiation between business, workers, and the general population — specifically for fast-food. The board decided to [raise minimum wages for fast-food workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/nyregion/cuomo-moves-to-raise-wages-for-new-york-fast-food-workers.html) across the state to $15/hr by 2021 (and even higher for New York City, reaching $15 by 2018). This was three years before the state began a shift to a $15 minimum wage for all workers.

- **Increasing unionization.** Unionized workers earn, on average, [13.6% more than non-unionized workers](http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/chart/swa-wages-table-4-33-union-wage-premium/). This varies widely by demographic — men on average see a 17.3% premium, Black and Hispanic workers see 17.3% and 23.1% respectively. And yet, union membership is currently half of what it was in the 1980s, sitting at a measly [10.8 percent](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm). Part of this has to do with the fact that the current fastest-growing sectors are ones that have never had high unionization rates. However, this decline also dates back to the Red Scare policies in the 20th century that [undermined unions based on accusations of Communist affiliation](https://psmag.com/economics/what-caused-the-decline-of-unions-in-america). But now that we’re in a new era where [unions have 65% of public support](https://news.gallup.com/poll/318980/approval-labor-unions-remains-high.aspx) (the highest its been since 2003), now may be the time for them to flourish. Dylan Matthews of Vox has written a [great article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/17/15290674/union-labor-movement-europe-bargaining-fight-15-ghent) about some ideas that the United States could borrow from Europe on boosting unionization, including negotiating at the sector-level rather than at the business-level.

- **Targeted minimum wage policies.** For example, establishing separate minimum wages per-county at the federal or state level, tying it to a percentage of the median or living wage in an area, or per-industry minimum wages as mentioned above. These have the possibility to be more flexible, more politically viable, and more in-line with economic variation between different industries and locations.

- **Increasing jobs.** As we discussed earlier, studies find that basic supply and demand theory holds true in the job market: when there are more jobs in an area, competition drives wages in the favor of workers. Diving into all of the policy ideas and economic factors related to this would take an entire episode, but the recent [American Jobs Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/) is an example of good policy that furthers this goal.

# Higher wages can’t be the only answer to financial insecurity

Raising wages is important, solvable, and can be done without putting a major dent in profits. However, there are a few reasons that this isn’t the end-all-be-all solution. Firstly, not everyone who works earns a wage. About [36% of workers](https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/gig-economy-statistics) — and growing due to companies like Uber, TaskRabbit, and Postmates consuming a chunk of the job market — are part of the **gig economy**, and many earn their primary income through contracting and/or freelancing. These people need an income that they can live on just as much as anyone else, and wage policies don’t do much to help them. Secondly, it’s important to remember that labor is a business expense, and while we can debate about which industries can afford to pay a living wage and whether or not this burden is overstated, everyone can agree that businesses have an interest in keeping their expenses to a minimum, and therefore will almost always fight tooth-and-nail against enforced wage increases. And lastly, a $15/hr wage, equivalent to about [$25,000](https://stackyourdollars.com/15-an-hour-is-how-much-a-year/#:~:text=Assuming you work 40 hours,make about $31,200 per year.) annually, [is not enough for most people to live on](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/03/the-income-a-family-really-needs-to-avoid-poverty-in-every-state/40706227/). Many economists believe that the problem of low wages and the volatility of the job market are something that can only be addressed long-term through a **basic income** policy.

Universal basic income is a program where every adult citizen gets a paycheck from the government that covers their living expenses unconditionally. Many have brought up [reasonable concerns](https://www.businessinsider.com/yang-warren-universal-basic-income-idea-bad-2019-11) about the cost of such a program, saying that if we simply multiply, say, Andrew Yang’s $1000/month proposal by the number of citizens, we get an estimate well into the trillions. This is known as the _gross cost_. However, factoring in citizens who are paying more into the program than they’re getting, we can arrive at the [real cost](https://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/real-cost-universal-basic-income/). There are several ways to calculate this, because there are several different ways to implement a UBI. What kind of taxes do we fund it with? What programs does it replace? How much do we give everyone? The answers to all of these vary depending on who you ask. What’s clear is that the most reasonable way to fund such a program is through high taxation on high-income — and perhaps middle-income — people. If the benefits and tax payments are part of the same transaction, this is known as a **negative income tax**.

![Wiederspan, J., Rhodes, E., & Shaefer, H. L. (2015). Expanding the Discourse on Antipoverty Policy: Reconsidering a Negative Income Tax. Journal of Poverty](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1856/1*IVsazWt5G0r4WdQ3FkxJ2g.png)

A [University of Michigan paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2014.991889) written by Jessica Wiederspana, Elizabeth Rhodesa, and H. Luke Shaefera, offers some examples of what an NIT policy might look like and how much it would cost. A policy that gets all citizens, including non-workers, above the poverty line would require about $219 billion in tax revenue (Table 3, pictured above). This is a reasonable amount which could be covered entirely by eliminating redundant programs such as housing aid, school food programs, and the earned income tax credit (Table 2, not pictured). However, the cost of living for an average family of two is [three to four times the poverty rate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/03/the-income-a-family-really-needs-to-avoid-poverty-in-every-state/40706227/), depending on location. So a negative income tax that actually furthers this article's goal would need to be much more generous, placing it closer to the $635 billion cost in the table above. By offering a low marginal tax rate (the amount that benefits taper off with increasing income), this would successfully put most working Americans above or close to the amount that it costs to live. This is an ambitious solution, but one absolutely worth considering.

Another potential concern that is commonly heard whenever basic income programs are brought up is the potential disincentive to work. After all, if you’re getting a paycheck that’s substantial enough to live on every month for doing nothing, why would you get a job? However, most local basic income experiments that have been done haven’t shown any significant loss of employment, which implies that other motivations such as a desire for additional income or an enjoyment of work tend to keep people wanting to work regardless of whether it’s required for them to live. We can’t make strong conclusions based on this, however, because it’s important to remember that all of these experiments were temporary and therefore people knew that they’d have to stick with their jobs long-term.

Alternatively, a cheaper yet similar solution would be to take advantage of a currently existing program: [expanding the earned income tax credit into a cost-of-living refund](https://costoflivingrefund.org). Currently, the EITC provides a tax refund that tapers off with income just like a negative income tax, but specifically goes to working citizens instead of all citizens (which, for the goal of this article in particular, is fine). It also mostly goes toward families with children, although Biden’s COVID stimulus bill [does expand benefits for childless individuals this year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/). The EITC provides a meaningful benefit for many workers, but it doesn’t help people cover the cost of living. If it was expanded to similar rates as the negative income tax proposal above and was paid out monthly, while still having the same qualifications of income and household size, it could be an incredibly effective solution. And due to its cheaper cost and the fact that it expands an existing program instead of creating a new one, it would likely be more politically viable than an NIT.

# Conclusion: What can be done?

- [**Raising the federal minimum wage gradually to $15/hour**](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/20/20952151/should-minimum-wage-be-raised) is something that would help millions of workers, and would likely have a minimal impact on employment.

- Until raising the federal minimum wage becomes more politically viable, we can increase wages on a granular level through [**state and local minimum wage policy]\*\*(https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx).

- We can also convene [**wage boards**](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/nyregion/cuomo-moves-to-raise-wages-for-new-york-fast-food-workers.html) at a local level to legislate policy that increases wages for particular industries.

- [**Higher unionization]**(http://www.stateofworkingamerica.org/chart/swa-wages-table-4-33-union-wage-premium/) and [**more jobs]\*\*(https://www.epi.org/publication/creating-jobs-and-economic-security/) have been proven to increase wages as well.

- In order to account for all types of workers, we also need solutions that aren’t centered around wages. The government should be providing payments in the form of a [**negative income tax**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10875549.2014.991889) (which provides for everyone) or an [**increase in the earned income tax credit]\*\*(https://costoflivingrefund.org) (which specifically goes to workers).
